# Report for Assigment 3

- Two semaphores are created: comsumed and produced. The semaphore comsumed is set to be 0 and produced is set to be 1. In the producer function, each loop before incrementing n, the process wait for the signal of consumed. Because the initial value of consumed is 1, the process will increment n by one and then signal produced making the semaphore produced to be 1. Only after this signal, the comsumer function can then print out the n value and signal consumed and for the next loop wait for the produced signal. After the application of semaphores, the two process wait for one loop of the other process, so the procedure becoms increasing n by 1 in producer and printing out n in the consumer.

- This synchronization can be accomplished by one semaphore. We can have one semaphore named comsumed with initial value 1. Before increasing n in producer, it waits for the signal. Then the comsumer prints out the n value and signal the consumed. By this loop the same result can be achieved. The only problem in this situation is the consumer may run another loop before the processer shift to producer because there is no wait in consumer. But the test result in xinu is preety good. So there is some potential problems in this implementation but this seems to work in our current enviroment.
